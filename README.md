# Ollama based XRay Report Generation
The code in this repository contains a prototype to demonstrate some examples of radiology reports generated by LLMS

## Setup

- Download the `Ollama` executable from the official website for your particular OS
- Install it on using the downloaded executable
- Install the following packages

```sh
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11
conda activate <env_name>
python -m pip install ollama opencv-python streamlit
```

## Running the code
```sh
streamlit run client.py
```
The above command should spawn a browser instance with the UI initialized. Upload an image of the X-Ray and enter the requisite prompt to obtain the generated summary
