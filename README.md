# Ollama based XRay Report Generation
The code in this repository contains a prototype to demonstrate some examples of radiology reports generated by LLMS

## Setup

- Download the `Ollama` executable from the official website for your particular OS
- Install it on using the downloaded executable
- Install the following packages

```sh
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11
conda activate <env_name>
python -m pip install ollama opencv-python streamlit matplotlib
```

## Running the code
```sh
streamlit run client.py
```
The above command should spawn a browser instance with the UI initialized. Upload an image of the X-Ray and enter the requisite prompt to obtain the generated summary

## Datasets Used
-   [Shoulder X-Ray Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dryari5/shoulder-xray-classification/data)
<!-- -   [NIH Chest X-Rays Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data/data) -->
- [Tuberculosis Chest X-Rays Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/tuberculosis-chest-xrays-montgomery)

### Additional utilities
The `create_img_mosaic.py` file takes in 3 xray images and concatenates side by side. 2 of these images are used as few shot examples.

```sh
python create_img_mosaic.py <ref_img_1> <ref_img_2> <test_img> <output_fpath>
```
